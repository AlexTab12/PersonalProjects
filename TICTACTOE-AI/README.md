# Pygame TIC-TAC-TOE with AI 
Welcome to the Pygame Tic-Tac-Toe with AI project! This project showcases a classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe implemented in Python using the Pygame library. With an added twist, the game features an AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm, meaning it is impossible to win against it.

##Key Features:

**Interactive Gameplay:** Enjoy a user-friendly interface built with Pygame, allowing players to interact with the game board using mouse clicks.

**Single Player Mode with AI:** Challenge yourself against an intelligent AI opponent, implementing the minimax algorithm to make strategic moves or play against a randomized AI.

**Two Player Mode:** Play against a friend locally on the same computer, taking turns to compete for victory.

##Technologies Used:

**Python:** The primary programming language used for game logic and AI implementation.

**Pygame:** A cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games, used for graphical user interface development.

**Minimax Algorithm:** Implemented for the AI opponent to make optimal moves and provide challenging gameplay.


##Controls:

**Press "R"** to reset the game board to its initial state, allowing for a fresh start.

**Press "G"** to switch the game mode to Player vs Player, enabling two players to compete against each other locally.

**Press "0"** to switch the AI opponent to a random picking state, where it selects its moves randomly, providing a different gameplay experience.
